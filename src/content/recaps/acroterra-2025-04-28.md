title: Entry I: Whispers, Weapons, and the Crimson Brand
---

The mists of Wildvale swirled thick as ever as our unlikely champions stepped deeper into the shadows of the city’s scheming heart. Having recently cracked the first of the four Veilstones beneath the desecrated cathedral, the group emerged marked—by power, by blood, and by purpose.

Their first stop: a crooked alley behind a crumbling tenement, where the eccentric artificer **BurrBin** still peddled illicit curiosities and delirium-drenched trinkets. Though his hands trembled from the weight of what he dared to smuggle, his craftsmanship remained keen. Each adventurer received a magical gift, forged from secret alloys and forgotten schematics—tokens meant to bolster them for what lay ahead.

From there, the group made their way toward the fractured heartbeat of Wildvale’s commerce: the **market district**, a once-proud plaza now echoing with half-empty stalls and whispered paranoia. Yet where others hid, *they* proclaimed. Boldly, the party cried out their chosen name—

> **"Two Crimson, Two Veil!"**

—a taunt cast like bait upon bloody waters.

And sure enough, something answered.

From the fringes of the crowd came snarling ruin: **two Nightbringers**, vampires long succumbed to the Blood Tide, feral and howling with hunger and madness. They struck without restraint, fang and claw lashing at stone and flesh alike. The battle was brutal, but swift. The party’s resolve—honed beneath the cathedral—held strong. Mist met steel, and silence returned to the square.

Yet violence was never the only path in Wildvale.

Wounds tended and eyes keener, the party sought the flickering flame of **Whispers in Wax**, the rumor-shop nestled like a secret in the alleyway's ribs. There, blindfolded **Maera** offered them melted truths in exchange for coin and questions unasked. Of **vengeance**, she spoke. Of **the Sunken Archives**, where crimson echoes still whispered. Of **House Draeven**, and the rot growing behind its noble doors.

As the party stepped back into the fog-drenched streets, the shadows were stirring, and their name—**Two Crimson, Two Veil**—was no longer a secret.
